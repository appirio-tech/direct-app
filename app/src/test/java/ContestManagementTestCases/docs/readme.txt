1. Please request a VM before reviewing. 

VM how-to: http://apps.topcoder.com/wiki/display/projects/Cockpit%2CDirect+VM



2. There are two main categories for contest types, one is Studio, the other is Software.

For all Studio contest types, they have the same steps and pages while launching contest, so we can select one for testing.

"Web Design" is selected.



For Software contest type, we can divide them into 4 groups:

1) Software Conceptualization, Software Architecture and Reporting
( All of these types can be held single-round or multi-rounds), we select "Software Conceptualization" for testing.

2) "Component Design" (It will ask the user if creating corresponding Development contest when finished).

3) "Component Development" (Has a "Dev-Only" checkbox).

4) Other software contest types all have the same format, we select "Software Assembly" for testing.


Happy reviewing!
