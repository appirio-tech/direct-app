In the "copilot-selected.html" the font size is set to "11px" which is automatically modified to "12px" while using "Chinese(Traditional Han)" 

I have modified the css so it looks better.

Please check the sanpshots in this submision.

Finally the problem is fixed for this page but the problem continues in other pages to topcoder website/
