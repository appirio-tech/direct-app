Separate test scenario document to 2 here. One is for future testing (Copilots_Management_Test_Scenarios(For future testing).xls). One is for current vm testing (Copilots_Management_Test_Scenarios(For vm site).xls). The reson for separate for it is because in future we may use 5 step process but at the moment we just need to cover 3 step process.

Final reviewer please just focus on review Copilots_Management_Test_Scenarios(For vm site).xls.

From forum post http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=725593&start=0, change the scenario document Copilots_Management_Test_Scenarios(For vm site).xls based on the vm site. Remove the original step2 and step3 page, move step4 and step5 page to step 2 and step 3. Update case steps for cases F40-F87.
