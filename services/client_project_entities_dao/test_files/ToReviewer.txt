[About Changes and Improvement]
1. There are problems to run GenericEJB3DAOTest and SearchByFilterUtilityImplTest simutaniously, but they can be run singlely. This problem already exists in the old source code, according to http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=664147&start=0.  I have tried to find the cause, it seems related to the max number of informix connections. which can not be solved since I am using Developer Edition.
2. I add some simply test cases for previous update, but they are not complete, just for coverage purpose. And PM has confirmed that they are not required. see http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=664070&start=0
3. I made some changes to the previous update, they does not work, according to the test, the problem is the sql script problem.
4. code clean up : unused imports and @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") tag are removed, etc.
5. imporvement: query are updated, like in CompanyDAOBean, Utils class is removed to reduce scope.
