This readme file explains how to setup and build this component.

1. Install the component structure in ${basedir}

2. Create "topcoder_global.properties" in ${basedir}/.. and add the properties from steps 2,3,4,5

3. The following standard build script properties must be set
	ext_libdir - root of third party libraries
	tcs_libdir - root of topcoder components

4. The following standard build script properties can be changed (defaults are noted)
	debug=off - as expected
	verbose=no - as expected
	cobertura.dir=${ext_libdir}/cobertura/1.8
		installation directory of cobertura script expects {$cobertura.dir}/cobertura.jar
		and {$cobertura.dir}/lib/containg Jars for asm, jakarta, and log4j to run cobertura task

5. Ant Commands:
	ant clean - removes temporary build files
	ant compile - builds the production code
	ant compile_tests - builds the test code
	ant test - runs the test code
	ant reports-all - generates javadoc and code coverage reports
	ant deploy-lib - moves the component runtime jar to the location where other components will look for it.

NB:
	The folder ${basedir}/test_reflib contains TopCoder components 
	that are required by this component's test code. This component is
	used to by compile_test and test targets. Components are listed under
	the following directory structure "component name"/"component version".
	Components are provided AS IS for development purposes only.
