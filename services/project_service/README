ABOUT THE TESTS:

* The tests in this submission only cover the methods and classes that added in this competition. The old
 test should cover the rest of the code.
* The old tests are included but are not executed by default. These tests were modified only so they
 can be compiled but some of them fail if executed. It was agreed that for this competition these test
 should not be fixed.
* There are some issues with using cobertura with jboss. So the coverage report is incorrect.

TO RUN:

1. Install the component structure in ${basedir}

2. Create "topcoder_global.properties" in ${basedir}/.. and add the properties from steps 2,3,4

3. The following standard build script properties must be set
	ext_libdir - root of third party libraries
	tcs_libdir - root of topcoder components
	cronos_libdir - root of cronos components
	java_1_5_bootclasspath - installation path for java 1.5 (only needed for compile_targets task)
	jboss_home - root of JBoss 4.2.3 installation.
	jboss_config_name - the name for the jboss configuration (default)

4. The following standard build script properties can be changed (defaults are noted)
	debug=off - as expected
	verbose=no - as expected
	cobertura.dir=${ext_libdir}/cobertura/1.8
		installation directory of cobertura script expects {$cobertura.dir}/cobertura.jar
		and {$cobertura.dir}/lib/containg Jars for asm, jakarta, and log4j to run cobertura task

Example:

junit.jar=${ext_libdir}/junit/4.6/junit.jar
cobertura.dir=${ext_libdir}/cobertura/1.8
cronos_libdir=C:/topcoder/tcs/lib/tcs
jboss_home=C:/Program Files/jboss-4.2.3.GA
jboss_config_name=default
java_1_5_bootclasspath=C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.5.0_21/jre/lib/rt.jar


NB:
	The folder ${basedir}/test_reflib contains some TopCoder components 
	that are required by this component's test code. These components are
    guaranteed work with jdk 1.5 (Components in the VM are compiled 
    with jdk6 so it is not possible to use them with a jvm 1.5).
    
    Components that are not included are common TopCoder components that
    are easy to find.

Setup
------------------------------------------------------

Database

1. install Informix and make sure the database is started.
2. create a database named 'project' in Informix.
3. use 'dbaccess project <path>/test_files/create.sql' to create database. it will create tables, sequences and
some entries that are supposed to exist.

NOTE 1: If these entries already exist (very likely if using the VM) in the DB they can be commented.
NOTE 2: The name of the used sequences can be configured in the file ejb-jar.xml so it is not necesarry to use
the sequences' names in this script.

4. change the ip address and port and username and password in test_files/informix-ds.xml and
test_files/InformixDBConnectionFactory.xml and test_files/META-INF/hibernate.cfg.xml.

Here, database is ready.

JBoss

1. Download and install JBoss 4.2.3.
2. It is recommended that you use JDK 1.5 to run jboss and the tests. When using JDK 1.6
  you must download and install the special version of JBoss 4.2.3 intended to run with
  JDK 1.6 and consider the following issue if the tests don't work:
  
  https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JBWS-1439?focusedCommentId=12500660#action_12500660
  
  The libraries in ${basedir}/test_reflib were all compiled with jdk 1.5.
  
2. modify <jboss-home>\server\default\conf\login-config.xml, adding

   <application-policy name="JBossLoginModule">
	    <authentication>
	      <login-module code="com.topcoder.security.auth.module.JBossLoginModule"
	        flag="required">
	        <module-option name="fileName"C:/topcoder/project_service_1.0.1/test_files/demoConfigs.properties</module-option>
	        <module-option name="password-stacking">useFirstPass</module-option>
	      </login-module>
	    </authentication>
  </application-policy>

  Notes, fileName property should be point to test_files/demoConfigs.properties file.

3. change demoConfigs.properties, using the correct path for JBossLoginModule.xml.

Build.xml

1. there are some settings need to be adjusted according to your environment.
like
1.1 "configuration for checkstyles"
1.2 "codertura task definitation"
1.4 See build-dependencies.xml for required tcs jars and third party jars. If some are missing
 they can be found in the VM but you have to be careful not to include libraries compiled for
 jdk 1.6 if using jdk 1.5 to run jboss.

Now, all the setup is ready. Let's start.

1. If JBoss is running stop it.
2. use 'ant deployEAR', to package ear file and deploy to jboss, a latest built is alredy saved as test_files/project_service.ear.
1. start JBoss 4.2.3
3. use 'ant test' to run the test cases.
4. 'ant undeployEAR' is used to delete the ear file in JBoss. and 'ant package.ejb' is used to package the ejb jar.
