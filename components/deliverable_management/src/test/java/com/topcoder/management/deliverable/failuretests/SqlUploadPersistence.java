/**
 * <p>
 * The SqlUploadPersistence class implements the UploadPersistence interface, in
 * order to persist to the database structure given in the
 * deliverable_management.sql script. This class does not cache a Connection to
 * the database. Instead a new Connection is used on every method call. Most
 * methods in this class will just create and execute a single
 * PreparedStatement. However, some of the methods will need to execute several
 * PreparedStatements in order to accomplish their tasks.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe in the sense that multiple threads
 * can not corrupt its internal data structures. However, the results if used
 * from multiple threads can be unpredictable as the database is changed from
 * different threads. This can equally well occur when the component is used on
 * multiple machines or multiple instances are used, so this is not a
 * thread-safety concern.
 * </p>
